First, I have downloaded the dataset from Australian Bureau of statistics, we have performed a trend analysis over the years six years time period i.e. 2016~2021, and in which I have selected the 'Industry Division' column of main jobs according to Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and then performed trend analysis on different age groups for the number of people employed in full-time jobs in the selected years. I found from the analysis that 25-34 age group has the highest employment rate in the tech sector, while 65 and over years people showed a consistent figures across the six years.
Second, I have taken another dataset from Onetcenter website which has all the skills related to the occupation required and deduced a radar chart showing the level of importance of certain skills in selected tech jobs and found interesting skills required by each techie, where Persuasive is the least required skillset.
